# LayerProcGen Example Project

This is a project showcasing what can be built with LayerProcGen.

## What is LayerProcGen?

LayerProcGen is a framework that can be used to implement layer-based procedural generation that's **infinite**, **deterministic** and **contextual**. It works out of the box in Unity but can be used in any C#-compatible engine.

## What is being demonstrated here?

Building on work due to Sythelux here, I provide a simple Terrain3D layer, and a VillageLayer on top of that.

This provides a network of "hamlets", using white cubes as a placeholder asset for now.

## Demonstration
